# alien_invaders_test
Game made with Pygame as part of a beginners' course.

The goal was to create a simple game with the "Space Invaders" base mechanics. It still has some small issues:

- If an arrow key is let go, the spaceship stops moving, even if the other arrow key was still pressed.
- There is no Main Menu screen.
- The enemy alien's hitboxes needs to be fixed for bullet collision.
